A repository for community-maintained documentation about the TypeScript compiler and its internal and external APIs.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome via pull request.  Docs don't need to be perfect, and this repo is expected to grow and improve organically.

We can also link to external resources, so you do not need to duplicate docs here if they already exist elsewhere.
